        <p> 
        <strong>Chipmunks</strong> are small, striped rodents of the family <i class="taxanomy">Sciuridae</i>. Chipmunks are found in North America, with the exception of the Siberian chipmunk which is found primarily in Asia.

        <h3>Taxonomy and systematics</h3>
    <p>Chipmunks may be classified either as a single genus, <i class="subgenera">Tamias</i>, or as three genera: Tamias, of which the eastern chipmunk (<i class="subgenera">T. striatus</i>) is the only living member; <i class="subgenera">Eutamias</i>, of which the Siberian chipmunk (<i>E. sibiricus</i>) is the only living member; and Neotamias, which includes the 23 remaining, mostly western, species. These classifications were treated as subgenera due to the chipmunks' morphological similarities.<sup>[2]</sup> As a result, most taxonomies over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks into a single genus. However, studies of mitochondrial DNA show that the divergence between each of the three chipmunk groups is comparable to the genetic dissimilarity between <i>Marmota</i> and <i>Spermophilus</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> <sup>[3]</sup> <sup>[4]</sup> <sup>[5]</sup> <sup>[6]</sup> so the three genera classification has been adopted here.</p>
